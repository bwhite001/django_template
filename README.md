Template Django Project with Docker
===================================

This is a template Django project that uses Docker to build and host the application. The project is structured in a way that allows you to quickly get up and running with Django using Docker. This template provides the basic setup for a Django project and includes Dockerfiles for building and running the application.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

Getting started
---------------

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
bashCopy codegit clone https://github.com/your-username/django-docker-template.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
bashCopy codecd django-docker-template

```

3. Build the Docker image:

```
Copy codedocker-compose build

```

4. Start the application:

```
Copy codedocker-compose up

```

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

Project structure
-----------------

The project structure follows the recommended Django project structure, with the addition of Dockerfiles for building and running the application. Here's an overview of the project structure:

```
cppCopy codedjango-docker-template/
├── app/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── config/
│   ├── settings/__init__.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── docker/
│   ├── django/
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   ├── entrypoint.sh
│   │   └── requirements.txt
│   └── nginx/
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       └── nginx.conf
├── static/
│   └── (static files)
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── docker-compose.yml
├── LICENSE
└── README.md

```

- The `app/` directory contains the Django application code.
- The `config/` directory contains the Django project configuration.
- The `docker/` directory contains the Dockerfiles for building the Django and Nginx containers.
- The `static/` directory contains static files for the application.
- The `.env` file contains environment variables for the Docker Compose configuration.
- The `docker-compose.yml` file contains the Docker Compose configuration for running the application.

Customization
-------------

To customize the Django project, you can modify the code in the `app/` and `config/` directories. You can also modify the Dockerfiles in the `docker/` directory to add additional dependencies or configurations.
